# Death Spawn
Death Spawn is a Spigot plugin that allows server administrators to set custom respawn locations based on the user's permissions.
## Usage
### Commands
`/deathspawn(ds) <create/delete> <name>` - Creates a new spawn with the given name.
### Permissions
`deathspawn.<spawn_name>` - The player will be teleported to that location upon death. (Note: giving a user multiple Death Spawn permissions will cause the plugin to use whichever permission it finds first, please ensure that there is only one Death Spawn permission per user)
## Misc
This plugin was developed for Isiah at EcoEvolution; however, it's completely open-source and you may use the code however you wish.
